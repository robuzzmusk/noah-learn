* [Makefile] (https://github.com/robuzzmusk/noah-learn/blob/main/Makefile)
* [requirements.txt] (https://github.com/robuzzmusk/noah-learn/blob/main/requirements.txt)
* [test library.py] (https://github.com/robuzzmusk/noah-learn/blob/main/test_devopslib.py)
* [python library] (https://github.com/robuzzmusk/noah-learn/tree/main/devopslib)

1. *Create the Virtual Environment*:
 
   python3 -m venv ~/.venv
   
3. *Edit Your .bashrc*:
   You need to add the activation command to your .bashrc file. You should add the 
   following line to your ~/.bashrc:
   
   source ~/.venv/bin/activate
   

4. *Reload Your .bashrc*:

   bash
   
   source ~/.bashrc
   

5. *Check Which Python*:
